        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the
            physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of
            science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from
            other natural phenomena.[1]

            The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or
            "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[2] In ancient
            philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which
            originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to
            develop of their own accord.[3][4] The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of
            several expansions of the original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by
            pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and
            has steadily gained currency ever since.

            During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive
            reality, organized and moved by divine laws. </p>

        <h2>Environment of India</h2>
        <p>India has some of the world's most biodiverse ecozones—desert, high mountains, highlands, tropical and
            temperate forests, swamplands, plains, grasslands, areas surrounding rivers and an island archipelago. It
            hosts three biodiverse hotspots: the Western Ghats, the Himalayas and the Indo-Burma region. These hotspots
            have numerous endemic species.[2]

            In 1992, around 7,43,534 km2 of land in the country was under forests and 92 percent of that belonged to the
            government. Only 22.7 percent was forested compared to the recommended 33 percent by the National Forest
            Policy Resolution (1952). Majority of it are broad-leaved deciduous trees which comprise one-sixth sal and
            one-tenth teak. Coniferous types are found in the northern high altitude regions and comprise pines,
            junipers and deodars.[3]

            There are 350 species of mammals, 375 reptiles, 130 amphibians, 20,000 insects, 19000 fish[4] and 1200
            species of birds in India. The Asiatic lion, Bengal tiger and leopard are the main predators; the country
            has the most species of cats than any other.[5] Elephants, the Indian Rhinoceros and eight species of deer
            are also found.[6]

            There are over 17000 species of flowering plants in India, which account for six percent of the total plant
            species in the world.

        <h2>The Maurya Period</h2>
        <p>The protection of animals became serious business by the time of the Maurya dynasty in the 4th and 3rd
            centuries BC. The first empire to provide a unified political entity in India, the attitude of the Mauryas
            towards forests, its denizens and fauna in general is of interest.

            The Mauryas firstly looked at forests as a resource. For them, the most important forest product was the
            elephant. Military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also battle-elephants;
            these played a role in the defeat of Seleucus, Alexander's governor of the Punjab. The Mauryas sought to
            preserve supplies of elephants since it was more cost and time-effective to catch, tame and train wild
            elephants than raise them. Kautilya's Arthashastra contains not only maxims on ancient statecraft, but also
            unambiguously specifies the responsibilities of officials such as the Protector of the Elephant Forests:[11]

            On the border of the forest, he should establish a forest for elephants guarded by foresters. The
            Superintendent should with the help of guards...protect the elephants whether along on the mountain, along a
            river, along lakes or in marshy tracts...They should kill anyone slaying an elephant.— Arthashastra
